# Govee Bluetooth Devices

This small application listens for bluetooth announcements from Govee H5074 bluetooth temerature sensors that I purchased from Amazon. They are nice, small, inexpensive, and battery run pucks that you can place around to track temperature.

I have one in the freezer, fridge, main room, and bedroom.

Incomming announcements are converted and published to local MQTT server. Naming scheme followed is close to Tasmota.
